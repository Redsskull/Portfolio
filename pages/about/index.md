## The Long Way Around

I spent my 20s and 30s training to become a commercial pilot. I earned my ATPL and CFA and learned what it means to operate inside safety-critical systems where mistakes compound quickly.

At 35, recurring kidney stones cost me my medical certification — and with it, my entire career.

After the loss, I rebuilt.

I installed Arch Linux, picked up Isaac Asimov, and started learning how computers actually work.

A web-focused bootcamp didn’t click. HTML and CSS felt like the *surface* of something much deeper.

Then I found CS50.

That’s where I realized programming isn’t about writing code — it’s about **designing systems**, reasoning about constraints, and making trade-offs under pressure.

When I finally solved Tideman after two weeks of failure, I knew I wasn’t just learning syntax. I was doing systems thinking again.

## Why DevOps Fits Me

**Aviation Trained Me for Operations**
Flying is systems engineering in real time: checklists, redundancy, failure modes, and calm decision-making when things don’t go as planned. DevOps felt familiar immediately — the same mindset, different machines.

**Distributed Systems Felt Like Home**
I grew up on IRC, Usenet, and early online communities. Latency, partitions, and partial failure weren’t academic concepts — they were daily reality. That intuition shows up naturally in how I design software.

**Rebuilding Taught Me Resilience**
Learning to program while managing chronic illness forced discipline, patience, and respect for limits. I don’t chase hype — I build things that last.

## How I Think

> “I’m a programmer who takes responsibility for systems after they’re deployed.
> If it runs in production, I want to understand it — and improve it.”

I respect frontend specialists and UI craftsmanship deeply. My strength is elsewhere: **backend systems, infrastructure, and operational reliability**.

## What I Build and Operate

* Backend services and APIs
* Distributed and concurrent systems
* Automation tooling and scripts
* Production deployments and environments
* Systems that fail predictably and recover cleanly

---

## Tools & Stack

**Primary:**
Go (concurrency & systems)
Python (data & automation)
Bash (glue & ops)
Podman (containers & reproducibility)

**Actively Learning:**
Distributed systems theory
Service orchestration
Observability and reliability patterns
Infrastructure as code concepts

## Where I’m Headed

I’m looking for **junior DevOps, SRE, platform, or backend systems roles** where:

* Reliability matters
* Curiosity is valued
* Learning happens in production
* Experience is measured in judgment, not years

I bring maturity, systems thinking, and respect for operational reality.

*I’ve lost one career already. I know how to rebuild — and how to keep systems in the air.*
