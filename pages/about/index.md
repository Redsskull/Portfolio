## The Unconventional Path

I spent my 20s and 30s as a pilot in training. I worked very hard and earned my ATPL and CFA certifications. At 35, recurring kidney stones cost me my medical certification - and with it, my entire career and investment.

After grieving that loss, I picked up Isaac Asimov's books, installed Arch Linux, and started exploring programming. I tried a bootcamp that focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - building websites and interfaces. It didn't click. That wasn't what interested me.

Then I found David J. Malan's CS50, and everything changed. I realized programming isn't about making things look pretty (though that's a valuable skill others excel at). It's about designing systems that work - understanding how pieces fit together, making architectural decisions, and building software that solves real problems.

When I solved Tideman after two weeks of frustration I knew I was a programmer, not just someone learning to code.

## What I Learned Along the Way

**Systems Thinking from Aviation**
Piloting isn't just about flying - it's about understanding complex systems, managing multiple variables, and making decisions under pressure. That foundation translates directly to programming: distributed systems, concurrent processes, and architectural design.

**Resilience from Rebuilding**
Losing my career and investment at 35 taught me how to start over. I learned to code while managing a chronic health condition, using meditation, Wim Hof breathing, and whatever tools I could find to stay focused. That taught me discipline and the ability to push through hard problems.

**Storytelling Through Code**
Reading Asimov taught me that the best systems have personality and emergent behavior. Whether it's a text adventure with branching narratives or a weather system that learns patterns, I'm drawn to software that does more than just compute - it thinks, adapts, and surprises.

## My Philosophy

> "I build minds, not just software. I grew up on IRC and Usenet, so I understand how distributed systems work at a fundamental level. I appreciate all developers - whether they build beautiful interfaces or robust backends - but my strength is in system design and architecture."

## What I Love Building

- **Backend systems** - The engines that power everything else
- **Distributed architecture** - P2P networks, concurrent processing
- **Intelligent systems** - Software that learns and adapts
- **Interactive stories** - Code that creates experiences
- **Reliable infrastructure** - Systems that work under pressure

## Tech Stack

**Primary:** Go (concurrent systems), Python (data processing), Bash (automation), Podman (containerization)

**Learning:** Distributed systems, P2P protocols, GraphQL, system architecture

**Background:** IRC, Usenet, Hotline - grew up understanding how networks actually work

## Why Programming?

After losing my aviation career, I discovered that programming gave me something I'd been missing: the ability to build complex systems that think and work. Aviation taught me to understand how pieces fit together. Programming lets me design and build those systems from scratch.

I'm 39, self-taught, and came to programming after losing everything once before. I know what it's like to rebuild. I know how to learn hard things. I know the difference between giving up and finding a better path.

## Currently

🔨 Building a P2P chat system (IRC nostalgia meets modern Go)
📚 Polishing portfolio projects with comprehensive documentation
🎯 Looking for junior backend/systems roles where maturity and resilience matter
💡 Learning in public, one head-bash at a time

## What I Bring

- **Systems thinking** from aviation background
- **Resilience** from rebuilding after loss
- **Maturity** from life experience
- **Depth** over breadth - I'd rather understand one thing deeply than ten things superficially
- **Passion** for building systems that work and tell stories
