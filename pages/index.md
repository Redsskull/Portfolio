# Building Systems That Survive Reality

I’m Nate — a **systems programmer** focused on reliability, automation, and intelligent infrastructure.

After an unexpected career change at 35, I discovered that programming isn’t about syntax or shiny interfaces (though those matter). It’s about **understanding systems**, anticipating failure, and building software that keeps working when conditions change.

I grew up on IRC, Usenet, and Hotline on my dad’s Macintosh — environments where systems were distributed, unreliable, and alive. That background made networking, concurrency, and infrastructure feel natural long before I knew the words *DevOps* or *SRE*.

Today I focus on **backend systems, automation, and operational tooling** — software that doesn’t just run, but *runs well*.

I like code that behaves like a living system: observable, resilient, and sometimes surprising.

## What I Build

**💼 [Stock Trading Simulator](/projects)**
Flask + PostgreSQL system with authentication, external APIs, environment-based configuration, and production deployment. Focused on data integrity, failure handling, and reproducible environments.

**🌤️ [Weather Intelligence System](/projects)**
Go + Python hybrid system using concurrent data collection and JSON orchestration. Designed to explore cross-language services, pattern recognition, and operational coordination.

**💬 [P2P Chat System](/projects)**
Production-ready distributed chat with UDP discovery, TCP connections, full-mesh networking, system installation, and cross-platform support. A hands-on exploration of reliability, discovery, and real-world networking.

**🎮 [Warcraft Logs CLI](/projects)**
GraphQL API client with OAuth2, caching, and structured analysis. Built to automate data retrieval, validate assumptions, and surface hidden system behavior.

**⚔️ [War Card Game](/projects)**
Cross-platform GUI built in Go using Fyne. My first fully shipped product — taught me packaging, distribution, and user-facing reliability.

**📖 [Knights and Creatures](/projects)**
A Python text adventure with branching logic and emergent behavior — my first experiment in systems that *tell stories*.

## What I Care About

* Reliability over cleverness
* Automation over repetition
* Observability over guessing
* Systems that degrade gracefully
* Infrastructure that developers trust
