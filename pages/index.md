# Backend Engineer Building Reliable Systems

I'm Nate — a **backend engineer** or really, a **technologist**. A term I learned from a great programmer called Radley Lewis (who made this [rssg!](https://github.com/radleylewis/rssg)) — focused on distributed systems, automation, and the beauty of networks.

After transitioning from aviation at 35, I discovered that programming is about understanding how systems behave under real conditions. I build backend services, CLI tools, and distributed systems — software that stays reliable when things go wrong.

I grew up on IRC and Usenet — environments where systems were distributed, unreliable, and required resilience. That background shaped how I think about networking, concurrency, and failure handling.

Today I focus on **backend systems, automation, and developer tooling** — code that's observable, maintainable, and designed to survive reality.

## Selected Client Work

**🔧 Ruby on Rails Web Application**
*Ruby on Rails · MySQL · JavaScript · REST APIs*
Full-stack web application built for a private client: user authentication, CRUD flows, relational database design from schema to deployment, and RESTful API integration. Built with Rails conventions and a deliberate eye on what the client actually needed — not what was technically interesting.

**⚙️ Go Service — Jellyfin & NAS Integration**
*Go · Jellyfin API · Concurrent I/O · Systems Integration*
A Go binary that concurrently scans a client's Synology NAS for new video files, calls the Jellyfin API to generate iframe embed links, and delivers structured data to the Rails app. Go chosen deliberately — lightweight goroutines to handle large directory trees within tight memory constraints. Three systems connected, each doing what it does best.

**🗄️ MySQL Schema Design**
*MySQL · Relational Design · Normalization · Indexing*
Database design for multiple clients — normalization, indexing, and data modelling built from direct client requirements and prepared for production load.

## Selected Projects

**💬 [P2P Chat System](/projects)**
Distributed chat with UDP discovery, TCP connections, and full-mesh networking. *My greatest passion — and my most opinionated code.*

**🎮 [Warcraft Logs CLI](/projects)**
GraphQL API client with OAuth2 and structured interrupt analysis. Discovered an undocumented API field through curl exploration. *A work in progress.*

**📖 [Ruby CLI Journal](/projects)**
Built in my favorite language, 1970s-style: code, books, and a ruler for debug. *This one made me a programmer.*

**🌤️ [Weather Intelligence System](/projects)**
Go + Python talking through JSON. *My first time making two languages cooperate.*

**💼 [Stock Trading Simulator](/projects)**
Flask + PostgreSQL, deployed to production. School project  *Everyone's gotta CRUD!*

## What I Value

* Reliability with humor
* Automation over repetition
* Observability over assumptions
* Systems that degrade gracefully
* Code that other developers trust
