# Backend Engineer Building Reliable Systems

I'm Nate — a **backend engineer** or really, a **technologist**. A term I learned from a great programmer called Radley Lewis (who made this [rssg!](https://github.com/radleylewis/rssg)) — focused on distributed systems, automation, and the beauty of networks.

After transitioning from aviation at 35, I discovered that programming is about understanding how systems behave under real conditions. I build backend services, CLI tools, and distributed systems — software that stays reliable when things go wrong.

I grew up on IRC and Usenet — environments where systems were distributed, unreliable, and required resilience. That background shaped how I think about networking, concurrency, and failure handling.

Today I focus on **backend systems, automation, and developer tooling** — code that's observable, maintainable, and designed to survive reality.

## Selected Projects

**💬 [P2P Chat System](/projects)**  
Distributed chat with UDP discovery, TCP connections, and full-mesh networking. Production-ready with system installation and cross-platform support. *This one's my greatest passion.*

**🌤️ [Weather Intelligence System](/projects)**  
Go + Python hybrid system with concurrent data collection and JSON orchestration. Built to explore cross-language services and operational coordination. *I made this to make two languages talk to each other somehow.*

**📖 [Ruby CLI Journal](/projects)**  
Terminal-based journaling application exploring Ruby's expressiveness for CLI design and backend logic. Currently in active development. *This one's in my favorite language.*

**💼 [Stock Trading Simulator](/projects)**  
Flask + PostgreSQL backend with authentication, external APIs, and environment-based configuration. Focus on data integrity and failure handling. *Everyone's gotta CRUD!*

**🎮 [Warcraft Logs CLI](/projects)**  
GraphQL API client with OAuth2, caching, and structured analysis. Automates data retrieval and surfaces hidden system behavior. *This one's huge — a work in progress that made me and Claude (Daneel) lose our minds.*

**⚔️ [War Card Game](/projects)**  
Cross-platform GUI built in Go using Fyne. My first fully shipped product — taught me packaging, distribution, and user-facing reliability. *My first foray into GUI.*

## What I Value

* Reliability with humor
* Automation over repetition
* Observability over assumptions
* Systems that degrade gracefully
* Code that other developers trust
